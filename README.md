## Limitations & Possible Improvements

- **Cannot float over other browser tabs or outside the browser window:**  
  The timer widget is restricted to the webpage it is loaded on and cannot overlay other apps or browser tabs.

- **No persistent state:**  
  Timer progress and position reset when the page reloads.

- **No notifications or alarms:**  
  The timer does not currently notify when time is up.

- **Could be developed into a desktop app:**  
  Using frameworks like Electron, this timer could run as a standalone app that floats above all windows.

- **Could be developed into a browser extension:**  
  Although limited to inside browser tabs, this would improve accessibility and distribution.
